# Spear Fishing Project

Using Google's Gmail API, this project aims to scan a user's Gmail inbox and detect potential phishing emails using Python. This project is still under development.

The next steps for this project include filtering out hyperlinks using regular expressions, as well as analyzing these links using tools such as Python's whois module.
