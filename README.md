# Gmail Phishing Detection

I started this project to experiment with using Google Cloud and Google's Gmail API to analyze email hyperlinks and detect potential phishing emails. I initially developed with Python, but upon considering my long-term goals for this project, I have decided to turn it into the beginnings of a chrome extension. I therefore am transitioning to JavaScript with the goal of developing an extension that, upon download, will alert Gmail users to suspicious emails.
